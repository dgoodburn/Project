# JOYNT
JOYNT is a Personal Finance Dashboard to give people visibility into accounts in multiple currencies. Its main goals are to:
- consolidate accounts/investments in all currencies;
- incorporate non-Bank data and historical data, including any accrual transactions;
- aggregate accounts for multiple people (couples and families);
- provide visibility into different sources of income: spending/investments/FX changes;
- provide budgeting and stock performance analysis
